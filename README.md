# Documents Application

The goal of this app is to provide a simple Document management app inside eXo Platform 3.5.

So, basically, my requirements are simple :  
- Allow to Drag n Drop multiple files directly from your Desktop to the browser
- Simple rename, Delete
- View properties like the size of each document
- Preview with thumbnail generation
- Link to download each file using WebDAV
- Public link to share the file to others
- Allow to tag files
- View by Documents, Images or Tags
- Upload new Version
- View Versions and Restore a previous Version
- Automatic Private User context or Space context in the Intranet.

This app was developped with eXo Platform 3.5 for the portal and documents stuff, Juzu to write the app and Bootstrap for the design.
